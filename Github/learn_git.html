    <h1>Introduction To Github</h1>
        <p>
            Git is free, Open Source Version Controll System. It was created by linux  Trovald in 2005. Many Developers
            on linux Kernel Developed this tool to work collectively.
            In real world developer work in teams and they need to know about each other codes. They have make sure 
            that their is no conflict between them. So this version Controll System Github help them a lot.
            <br>
            Most of the time the requirement of the project change with time so developers can go back to their 
            older version of code and make changes. That's cool.
            Basically think Github as a small software application that controll your code base , if your a Develoer.
            The branch System in Git allows developers to work indivisually on a specific task.<br>

            <h2> Git Repositories</h2>
            To start working in Github we need to know where we have to host our Repositories. A Repository ("repo")
            is project which contains multiple files. In our case it will contain code-based files.
            Two ways to host your files<br><b>1. One is online(on clod) 2. Offline Self installed on your server</b>
            There are three popular Github hosting services <ul>
                <li> Github(owned by microsoft)</li>
                <li> Gitlab(owned by Gitlab)</li>
                <li>Bitbuket</li>
            </ul>
            We will use Github as our hosting service because there are several reasons!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <h2> Why we need Github Brads?</h2>
            <h3>1.Git make it easy to contribute to open source projects</h3>
            Most of the open-source projects uses github to manage thier projects. The reason is in open-source 
            any one can contribute for the code and Using Github is free if your project is open-source and it includes
            <em>Wiki and issue tracker</em> that makes it easy to include more in-depth documentation and get 
            feedback backs about your project quickly.<br>
            If you want to contribute you just have to fork (get a copy) a project, make changes and then send a pull 
            request using Github's web-interface. This pull reqest is your way of telling projest that you are ready to 
            review changes.<br>
            <h3>2.Documentations</h3>
            Using github ,you make excellant Docuementations. Their help Section and guide have article related 
            to all topics about Github that you can think of.
           

        </p>

        <p>
            <h3> 3.Integration Option</h3>
            Another cool feature is Integration and it can integrate with Amazon and Google-Cloud with services such 
            as code climate to track your feedback and highlight syntax in nearly 200 Programming languages.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3> 4.Track Changes in your code across Version</h3>
            As multiple people collaborate in a project and they make many changes in the code. It is a heptic
            task for developer to keep a track of revisions- who changed what , when and where those files are stored.
            <br>
            But thanks to Github it is taking care of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository.
            <br>
            Much like using Microsoft Word or Google Drive you can have a version history of your code that previous
            version history of your code  so that previous version are not lost with every iteration. It is really easy to 
            comeback to previous version and contribute to your work.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3> Showcase Your Work</h3>
            Are you a developer who wishes to attract recruiiters? Then Github is the best tool you can rely on for this.
            Today for a new recruit for thier project people look at the Github profile they will never check your
            university background.
